== Variable Types

- When an object is initiaded, it is assigned a unique object id. It's type is defined at runtime and once set can never
change, however it's state can be changed if it is mutable. Simple put, a mutable object can be changed after it is
created; immutable object can't.

- Mutable Object: Objects that can change after creation. (list, set, dict)

- Immutable Object: Objects that can't change after creation. (int, float, bool, str, tuple, unicode)

- Immutable Table:

== Usage of Asterisk - Send Multiple Parameters to Function with *Args and **Kwargs

- *args: Non-Keyword Arguments
    * Using the *, the variable that we associate with the * becomes an iterable meaning you can do things like iterate 
    over it, run some higher-order functions such as map and filter, etc.
- **kwargs: Keyword Arguments
    * A keyword argument is where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function.

- We can unpack variables with using args and kwargs.

- single asterisk (*) is using for unpack iterables.
-- result return as tuple.

- double asterisk (**) is using for unpack dictionaries.
-- result return as dict.

.Unpacking With args or kwargs
[source, python]
----
include::asterisk/unpacking.py[]
----

.Output
[source, console]
----
Our List:  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] 

Unpack our list with * -> Asterisk
6 7 8 9 10 11

Unpack [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] with multiple *args
6 [7, 8, 9, 10] 11
----

- We can merge items with using args or kwargs (depends on data type)

.Merging items with Asterisk Operator
[source, python]
----
include::asterisk/merging.py[]
----

.Output
[source, console]
----
Two lists: [5, 6, 7] and [5, 66, 77]
Merged List with Asterisk: [5, 6, 7, 5, 66, 77]


Two dicts: {'a': 2, 'b': 3, 'c': 4} and {'c': 6, 'd': 41, 'e': 19}    
Merged Dict With Asterisk: {'a': 2, 'b': 3, 'c': 6, 'd': 41, 'e': 19} 
----

- args or kwargs names are just names. We can change this names when we are using. Important part is the asterisk(*)

- We can send parameters to a function without using args or kwargs, of course. But sometimes we wouldn't know how many
parameters come to our function. In that cases, we can use args or kwargs.

.Multiple Parameters Wihtout Args/Kwargs Examples
[source, python]
----
include::asterisk/multiple_parameters_one.py[]
----

.Output
[source, console]
----
1. element: 6
2. element: 7
3. element: 8
4. element: 9
Sumamry of Integer List:  30
***********************
Numbers are 14 and 15
Summary of Two Numbers:  29
----

- We can use *args for list type variables.

.Multiple Parameters with *args
[source, python]
----
include::asterisk/multiple_parameters_two.py[]
----

.Output
[source, console]
----
*args seems like:  ((6, 7, 8, 9),)
*args type is:  <class 'tuple'>
(6, 7, 8, 9)
***********************
*args seems like:  (6, 7, 8, 9)
*args type is:  <class 'tuple'>
1. element: 6
2. element: 7
3. element: 8
4. element: 9
Summary of Integers:  30
----

- We can use **kwargs for dictionary type variables.

.Multiple Parameters with **kwargs
[source, python]
----
include::asterisk/multiple_parameters_three.py[]
----

.Output
[source, console]
----
**kwargs seems like:  {'a': 6, 'b': 7, 'c': 8, 'd': 9}
**kwargs type is:  <class 'dict'>
a:6
b:7
c:8
d:9
Sumamry of Numbers:  30

- When defining a function, every parameter has its own order.

.Defining Function with * Operator
[source, python]

== Decorators

- Decorators provide simple syntax for calling high order functions.
- High Order Function: In mathematics and computer science, a high-order function is a function that does at least one
of the following:
    * take one or more functions as arguments (i.e procedural parameters),
    * returns a function as its result.
- All the other functions are first-order functions.
- By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behaviour of the latter function
without explicitly modfying it. And we use decorator a lot :D

== Design Patterns

- Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. These
solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a sibstanial period of time.

=== Singleton

- Why singleton?
- Give examples.

== Context Managers

- Why we need?
- Common Usages
- Our Examples

== Multithread

- Why we need?
- Common Usages

== Garbage Collector

- Why we need?

- The Garbage Collector is keeping tarck of all objects in memory. A new object starts its life in the first generation
of the garbage collector. If Python executes a garbage collection process on a generation and an object survives, it
moves up into second, older generation.

== Optimization

- Maybe game or demo examples. (DEMO CULTURE)
