Wet sand

My shadow side so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary son but it's so
My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent why do you care?
Someone start the car, time to go
You're the best I know
My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen
Are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro
My what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better, baby
God knows that I really tried
My what a good day for a take out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better of
I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary son but it's so
The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty going toe to toe
My what a good day for a let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better of
I thought about it
And I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter
Right on the verge, just one more dose
I'm travelling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect but it's close
I'm almost there, why should I care?
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up, let it show
My what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better of
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter
Oh you don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
I do
Yeah
